You will work with the SIFT tutorial and code from the University of Toronto. In the compressed homework file, you will find the tutorial document (tutSIFT04.pdf) and a paper from the International Journal of Computer Vision (ijcv04.pdf) describing SIFT and object recognition. Although the tutorial document assumes matlab implemention, you should still be able to follow the technical details in it. In addition, you are **STRONGLY** encouraged to read this paper unless you’re already quite familiar with matching and recognition using SIFT.\n","\n","There are 2 problems in this homework with a total of 100 points.
